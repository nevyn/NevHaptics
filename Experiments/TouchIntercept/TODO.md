# Todo

- [ ] Make touch tracing hit the view under finger, instead of the event's view
- [ ] Figure out what's going on with coordinate systems for edge tracing
- [ ] Fix begin events for deep presses, so we can interact with controls :P
- [ ] Disable event intercepts when on a keyboard window
- [ ] Do fancy "release" texture for scroll view
